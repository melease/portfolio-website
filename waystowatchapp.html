        <h1>Ways to Watch iOS App</h1>
        <p>Ways to Watch is a native iOS and web movie and TV show streaming search app that allows users to easily search for where movies and TV shows are available to stream, both for free as well as paid. For this student project, I came up with
          the concept and executed on all phases of the process.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <!-- Ojectives, etc. -->
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Who: People that enjoy watching movies or TV shows, have subscriptions to at least a couple streaming services </li>
        <li>What: An app that will let users to find which streaming services have movies or shows they want to watch.</li>
        <li>When: When users want to watch a movie or show, likely in the evening.</li>
        <li>Where: Likely at home but could also be at places where there is significant time to kill with Wifi, like an airport.</li>
        <li>Why: Users want a resource to find where their favorite movies or TV shows are playing via streaming without having to individually search </li>
        <li>How: Users will need to input what movie or TV show they want to watch or utilize the browse feature.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>People want a user-friendly app or website that is a one-stop-shop, (so-to-speak) for searching for movies and TV shows, eliminating the need to search on each streaming service’s app or website, which will save time and hassle. </p>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p>Some questions asked:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Occupation</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Marital Status</li>
        <li>How many movies do you stream on average every week? </li>
        <li>How many TV shows do you stream on average every week?</li>
        <li>If there is a specific movie or show you want to watch, what’s your method to find it? </li>
        <li>How many streaming services do you subscribe to? </li>
        <li>Name your top 3 streaming services. Why are they your top 3? </li>
        <li>When you’re not sure what movie or show to watch, how do you gauge what movie to watch? (i.e. genre, year made, actors, rating, etc.)</li>
        <li>What kind of information do you want when looking for a show or movie? (i.e. synopsis, cast, year made, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Synthesis</h2>
      <p>Streaming has become the way to watch movies and shows. Most people subscribe to mutliple streaming services. Typically, people tend to go to the individual streaming service directly to search for content. Thus by having one place to search
        for content, users will be able to save significant time. Additionally, not only will this app locate where to watch but also further movie/show details than most streaming apps provide, almost as much as IMDB.</p>

      <!-- Moodboard -->
      <h2>Moodboard</h2>
      <p>Movies and TV shows are entertaining and in a traditional sense, going to the movies occurs in the evening, as does much movie and TV watching. Dark background with vibrant accents work well for this category, specifically colors in the red
        family. I found several sources of Inspriation from Dribbble and Behance, as seen below.</p>

      <!-- Colors - Left col -->
      <h2>Colors</h2>
      <p>The red family is often associated with film and going to the movies. I took a traditional red and made it a bit more modern and vibrant by lighting it up a bit. In order to have some flexibility with an accent color, I also selected a
        yellow that would work well for popping against the red as well as in a gradient. The dark gray works for backgrounds to represent going to the movies or watching movies at night. </p>

      <!-- Typography - Right col -->
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>Akzidenz-Grotesk is also like Gotham condensed which is what I was going for in general look and feel. The condensed nature of the typeface allows for easy stacking. Additionally, it is crisp, clean and legible. Akzidenz-Grotesk will be used
        for key titles and is essentially the hero typeface. SF Pro will be used for the majority of the app’s body copy as well as headings, buttons, etc. </p>
      <img src="img/Ways to Watch/Ways to Watch Typography.jpg" alt="Typography">

      <!-- Logo -->
      <h2>Logo</h2>
      <p>Movies and TV can often be associated with the traditional play button. The play button is used heavily in the entertainment category. Initially I was looking to incorporate some element of streaming in the logo as well but found it was not
        necessary since the majority of movies and TV can be streamed in today’s technologically advanced world. Since smart TV’s allow for streaming of multiple sources, incorporating some element of smart into this logo made sense. The geometric
        shapes represent multiple networks. It is also an abstract and modern approach to a highly saturated play symbol. </p>
