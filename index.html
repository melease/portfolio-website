            <h3>Figma Design System UI Starter Kit</h3>
            <p>Content in this Figma kit is based on my professional experience as well as World Wide Web Consortium’s (w3c) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS), the Tailwind CSS framework and a variety of
              other reputable resources. Additionally, it features a uniquely spacious, responsive and modern grid system (see “layout”).

            <h3>AHA Web Experience Redesign</h3>
            <p>The American Hospital Association's (AHA) Central Office serves as the official U.S. Clearinghouse on medical coding for the proper use of coding systems for hospital providers, hospitals, physicians and other health professionals.
              They selected my agency to do this project due to our expertise in both healthcare and development. I led and executed design on all main page designs at extra-small and extra-large sizes and created a small, yet powerful, design system
              with established components, text styles, icons and other UI elements. Additionally, I led regular, bi-weekly design reviews with the key stakeholders to ensure continual progress was made during each sprint and ultimately deadlines
              were met. The main objectives for this project were to: Simplify the UX experience, Create a unified experience for users across the central office and coding clinic, Streamline the account creation and login process and to Manage
              content changes without support from a web developer.</p>
