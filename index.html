          <h3>Ways to Watch iOS App</h3>
          <p>Ways to Watch is a native iOS and web movie and TV show streaming search app that allows users to easily search for where movies and TV shows are available to stream, both for free as well as paid. For this student project, I came up
            with
            the concept and executed on all phases of the process.</p>

          <h3>AHA Web Experience Redesign</h3>
          <p>The American Hospital Association's (AHA) Central Office serves as the official U.S. Clearinghouse on medical coding for the proper use of coding systems for hospital providers, hospitals, physicians and other health professionals.
            They selected my agency to do this project due to our expertise in both healthcare and development. I led and executed design on all main page designs at extra-small and extra-large sizes and created a small, yet powerful, design system
            with established components, text styles, icons and other UI elements. Additionally, I led regular, bi-weekly design reviews with the key stakeholders to ensure continual progress was made during each sprint and ultimately deadlines
            were met. The main objectives for this project were to: Simplify the UX experience, Create a unified experience for users across the central office and coding clinic, Streamline the account creation and login process and to Manage
            content changes without support from a web developer.</p>
